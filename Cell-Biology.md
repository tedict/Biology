# Cell Biology

The cell is the basic structural, functional, and biological unit of all known living organisms. A cell is the smallest unit of life. Cells are often called the "building blocks of life". The study of cells is called cell biology.

* Bacteria is single celled organism about one micrometer long
* Human cells are around 10 to 100 micro meter wide
* Largest cell is egg
* Smallest human cell is sperm

Cells can be of different shapes

### What cell contains?

Roughly 70% of cell contains water. It also contains Nucleus, Endoplasmic reticulum and many vesicles

Cell by itself is a living entity because

* Each cell by itself must be able to **reproduce** by storing and transmitting genetic information
* Each cell must be able to regulate its internal environment as it adopts over time in response to its external environment.
* Each cell must be able to harness energy from the environment to do work.
